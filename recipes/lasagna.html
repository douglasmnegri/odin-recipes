        <h2>Step by Step - <em>Ragu</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat half the oil in the pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add 2-3 beef pieces. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until browned.<p>Transfer to a large plate.Repeat, in 3-4 batches, with remaining beef.</p></li><br>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in the pressure cooker over medium heat. Add celery, carrot, onion and garlic. <p>Cook, stirring often, for 3-4 minutes or until soft.</p></li><br>
            <li>Add the beef, passata and wine, and stir to combine. Dissolve the stock cube in the water. <p>Add the stock, bay leaves, oregano and sugar. Season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine.</p></li><br>
            <li>Seal the pressure cooker. Heat over high heat until steam escapes at a constant rate and there is a regular hissing sound. <p>Reduce heat to low. Cook for 40 minutes. Release steam following manufacturer's instructions.</p></li><br>
            <li>Use tongs to remove beef from the pressure cooker. Shred beef. Return beef to pressure cooker. Stir to combine. <p>Add pasta and stir to combine. Divide among serving bowls. Top with parmesan to serve.</p></li><br>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Step by Step - <em>Bechamel Sauce</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure 45 ml (3 tablespoons) of butter and 45 ml (3 tablespoons) of flour per 500 ml (2 cups) of milk.</li><br>
            <li>Melt the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, add 1/2 chopped onion and stir until tender and almost translucent (looks like you can see through them!).</li><br>
            <li>Let the butter and flour mixture cook for 1 minute over medium heat, whisking constantly. That way, your bechamel wonâ€™t taste like flour.<p>This step is called making a roux. The roux is used to thicken your milk and give you a nice creamy sauce.</p></li><br>
            <li>Add the milk and a pinch of nutmeg, stiring constantly with a whisk.<p> Bring to a boil (over medium-high heat). If you stop whisking, your sauce will be lumpy.</p></li><br>
            <li>When the consistency of your sauce becomes thick and creamy (you feel your arm getting tired of stirring!),<p> remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. Taste before seasoning.</p></li>
        </ol>
